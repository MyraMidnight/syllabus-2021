# Week 3 Assignment

**Turn in your GitHub repository URL into Canvas solo or in pairs (please add `kthorri`, and `ironpeak` as collaborators)**

Your Circle CI Pipeline should be running:

- Lint
- Unit-Test
- Build
- Publish
- Acceptance-Test + E2E
- Capacity-Test
- Deploy

You should store all the source files in your repository:

```bash
# Hidden gem: Extra points for the first one to create a pr with the new tree
```

Your `README.md` file should include the URL to the instances running:

- The game client `connect4.{{team-name}}.hgopteam.com`
- The game server `connect4-server.{{team-name}}.hgopteam.com`

If you did anything extra, you should list it up in the `README.md` if you
want us to take it into account.
